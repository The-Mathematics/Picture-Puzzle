# Picture Puzzle

## Our Goal

The Objective of this project is to use 2D Arrays, UISwipeGestureRecognizers, AVFoundation and Shuffled() Method to make a Picture Puzzle Game.


## What the app does

The App starts by giving you a glimpse of the picture puzzle to be solved,Then you click the "RESET" Button to shuffle the tiles/puzzle pieces - Then you swipe pieces of the puzzle into the adjacent position to get the picture  

## Ideas Implemented

Read the Documentation to fully understand what methods/libraries were used in making this and attached to this git repo is a text file containing swift code example on creating a 2D Array and locating an object in it by unwrapping the array and moving the object when it meets certain conditions
